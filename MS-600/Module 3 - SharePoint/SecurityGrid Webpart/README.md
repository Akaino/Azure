# Security Grid

## Summary

React-securitygrid is an SPFX web part that uses React and Office-UI-Fabric to render a grid showing which users have access to which lists/libraries/folders/files on a Web as shown here:

![config panel](./src/images/MainDisplay.gif)

Empty libraries are displayed with a black folder icon, those with items are displayed with a white folder. The user can expand a list or library by clicking on the desired row. (If the library or folder has more than 5000 items an error will be displayed ) For deeply nested folders the Title column can be resized by drag and drop. The display shows a the appropriate icon circle if the user has the selected permission to the given list, library, file or folder. (NOTE:The grid does not currently take into account access give via membership in an active directory group-- coming soon!). IMPORTANT: The user must have permissions to access lists and enumerate permissions in order to view the grid.

The user can change the permission being tested by clicking the Permission in the command bar and selecting a new Permission:
