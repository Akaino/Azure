# Azure Functions (durable)
###### Patterns

Azure Functions are stateless. And they should be treated as such.

That being said, what if we need to presume state? Correct! That's where `Durable Functions` take place!

With `Durable Functions` you're able to provide stateful logic in a serverless environment.

There are different patterns for different use-cases. There will be a very simple  example for each of these patterns in this repository.

The following patterns will be treated:
